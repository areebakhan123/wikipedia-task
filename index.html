    the tottenham hotspur first and second team in 1885
    <br>
    <p>English <font color="blue">Football</font> club based in Tottenham, London. They came into existence in 1882,
        became professional in 1895,
        and in <font color="blue">1901</font> became the only non-League club to win the FA Cup since the establishment
        of the Football League.
        They have won the FA Cup a further seven times, the Football League twice, the League Cup four times, the UEFA
        Cup twice and, <font color="blue">in 1963,</font> the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. In 1960–61, they became the first
        team to complete The Double
        in the 20th century. The club languished mostly in the Second Division from the late 1920s until the 1950s
        before peaking in the 1960s, with a resurgence in the 1980s. They have remained a member of the Premier League
        since its formation in 1992, finishing in mid-table most seasons. In 1899 the club moved from Northumberland
        Park to a site that became known as White Hart Lane, and remained there until 2017. A new stadium has been built
        at the same site. (Full article...)

        A map of the the French city of Brest, dated to around 1700. Located in the Finistère department of Brittany,
        Brest lies in a sheltered bay close to the western extremity of metropolitan France. Originally named Bresta,
        possibly derived from a Celtic word meaning hill, the city came under the rule of the duke of Brittany in 1240.
        From 1342 to 1397 the city was under English rule, and became part of France in 1491 when a marriage unified
        Brittany with the French crown. Cardinal Richelieu designated the city a major naval base in 1631, a status it
        retains today. The city centre was mostly rebuilt after heavy Allied bombing during World War II.
